      <p className="text-[16px] md:text-xl mb-4 font-regular md:font-medium">
        FitAdvice is an application that connects consumers who wish to engage in physical exercise with professional trainers. This platform facilitates the management of trainers schedules and their remuneration, aiming to minimize missed appointments and income loss for professionals. Additionally, through this application, consumers can benefit from personalized coaching provided by certified trainers, regardless of their geographical location.
        <br />
        <br />

        To ensure optimal follow-up of consumers, trainers will have access to a customer file containing their physical data, goals, and training history. This approach will enable trainers to better understand the needs of their clients and provide them with a more tailored service based on their situation.
